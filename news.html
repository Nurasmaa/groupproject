        <p><b>Covid-19: KFC denies viral claim that its poultry supply comes from a Pedas processing plant where staff have allegedly tested positive</b></p>
        <p>KFC Malaysia has denied an unverified report claiming that the company’s poultry supply comes from a chicken processing plant in Pedas, Negeri Sembilan, where staff have allegedly tested positive for Covid-19.

“We would like to assure our customers that KFC Malaysia is not associated with the plant and that it does not supply any poultry to KFC Malaysia,” the company said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page.

The company reassured that “every aspect of its food manufacturing process follows strict controls and accepts only certificates recognised by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) and strictly adheres to MS1500:2009 (Malaysian Standard on Halal Food)”.

“We work closely with our existing poultry suppliers to ensure the food we serve complies with the highest food safety and hygiene standards,” the statement reiterated.

When contacted by Lifestyle Tech, KFC Management said the statement was issued after it discovered an unverified report in PDF format that has been circulating among users on messaging services like WhatsApp.

The report claimed that KFC is one of many companies that gets its supply from a poultry processing plant in Pedas where up to 60 workers have tested positive for Covid-19 and was purportedly prepared by the Veterinary Service Department in Putrajaya, dated May 9, 2020.

Users who shared the message warned others not to purchase or consume chicken for the time being out of fear that it may carry traces of Covid-19.

However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a report stated that it is “highly unlikely that people can contract Covid-19 from food or food packaging”.

“Covid-19 is a respiratory illness and the primary transmission route is through person-to person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply,” WHO said in a ‘Food And Safety: Guidance For Food Businesses’ report.

Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah has also stated that there is no indication that Covid-19 can spread through food.

“We have not heard of the virus spreading through food, but most importantly if one of the workers is tested positive, we have to screen the close contacts in the restaurant,” he said in a press conference on April 5.

The Veterinary Service Department told Lifestyle Tech that it will issue an official statement on the matter later today.

Fake news related to Covid-19 has become major issue in Malaysia that is prompted authorities to step up efforts to combat misinformation. The Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has opened up 262 investigations papers related to Covid-19 fake news, according to the Ministry of Defence via Twitter on May 12.

It added that 179 reports are still under investigation, 29 cases have been charged in court, 11 were issued warning notices and 18 have pleaded guilty.</p>

        <p><b>KFC MALAYSIA UNVEILS ‘11 FINGER LICKIN’ GOOD GOODS’
WITH PESTLE & MORTAR CLOTHING</b></p>
        <p>Kuala Lumpur, 5 SEPTEMBER 2019 - KFC Malaysia today debuts The 11 Finger Lickin’ Good Goods, after announcing their collaboration with popular home-grown streetwear brand, Pestle & Mortar Clothing (PMC), featuring exclusive limited edition pieces that pays homage to KFC’s heritage in Malaysia.

Available from today on Pestle & Mortar Clothing website and at Major Drop, Sunway Pyramid, this exclusive KFC x PMC collection comprises 11 streetwear pieces – a clever spin on Colonel Sanders’ 11 secret herbs and spices.

“Malaysia has been KFC’s home for more than 46 years. We wanted to do something out of the ordinary to celebrate Malaysia, Malaysians and KFC’s heritage in Malaysia. With the rise in streetwear trend, the idea of a collaboration with Pestle & Mortar Clothing, a Malaysian streetwear brand known for incorporating current issues and local flavour in their designs, was spot on. The result is a collection that creatively highlights the brand’s heritage and the common connections that KFC has built with Malaysians since 1973. Truly inspired by Malaysians, made by Malaysians for Malaysians,” said Angelina Villanueva, Chief Marketing Officer, KFC Malaysia.

Using Malaysia’s unique art and local lingo, PMC interpreted KFC Malaysia’s origins on apparel and gave it a contemporary streetwear twist. The collection ranges from graphic and statement tees to all-over print bowling shirt as well as large graphic bomber jacket and accessories such as reversible bucket hat and tote bag.

“More than just a design, each garment tells a story of what KFC means to each and every Malaysian, from the beautiful Jalan Larut KFC on a Tee, to the playful ‘Atuk’ nickname bestowed upon the Colonel, even right to the pressure cooker, there is a memory that resonates with everyone,” said Hugh Koh, Co-founder and Creative Director, Pestle & Mortar Clothing.

The launch of the 11 Finger Lickin’ Good Goods further underscores KFC Malaysia’s commitment to contribute positively to the community. Total proceeds from the campaign will be channelled to Add Hope Malaysia, KFC’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative that aims to address and alleviate hunger. Running in its 13th year, Add Hope Malaysia is an on-going initiative that raises funds and distributes assistance to local beneficiaries including charity homes, NGOs, government bodies and underprivileged families across Malaysia.

The collection is now available at Major Drop, Sunway Pyramid and online at pestlemortarclothing.com. Be warned though, it’s a limited edition collection.

Just like KFC’s 11 secret herbs and spices, these 11 Finger Lickin’ Good Goods will make you drool like you’re drooling over a bucket of Original Recipe fried chicken. .</p>

In line with QSR Brands’ commitment to provide enhanced services and accessibility to all Malaysians, the opening of KFC Kangar Jaya Drive-Thru marks its sixth location in Perlis, further anchoring the brand’s presence with a total of 740 restaurants nationwide.

Developed through a collaborative partnership between QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd (QSR Brands); with developer Konsortium Bumita Nepta Sdn. Bhd., this new opening aims to cater to the existing demand, while adding to the commercial value of Bandar Baru Kangar Jaya – a new township venture by the same developer.

Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Ibni Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Jamalullail, Raja Muda Perlis together with Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Tuanku Hajjah Lailatul Shahreen Akashah Khalil, Raja Puan Muda Perlis; graced the occasion to officiate the opening of KFC Kangar Jaya Drive-Thru.

Also present during the ceremony was Yang Berhormat Dato’ Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim, Chairman of QSR Brands.

Raja Muda Perlis recognises the collaborative partnership between the two local companies as a good move to stimulate the state’s economic development, through the increased employment opportunities and enhanced services provided for the community.

He specified, “Perlis is a state blessed with abundance of natural resources and untapped potential. Such partnership needs to be intensified in order to unlock the true potential of Perlis, thus raising its competencies tantamount to other states in terms of development, human capital, economy, investment, and entrepreneurship. This indirectly upholds the government’s commitment to achieve balanced and equitable development across all economic classes, ethnic groups, geographical territories and supply chain through the 2030 Shared Prosperity Vision.”

Speaking the ceremony, Dato Seri Mohamed Azahari Mohamed Kamil, Managing Director of QSR Brands said, “We are so delighted to receive such a warm welcome by the people ever since KFC Kangar Jaya Drive Thru began its operation last November. Today’s diners prefer convenience and holistic experience. For that, QSR Brands designed its strategies around convenience-driven efforts and our new developments are increasingly equipped with 24-hour drive-thru and digital ordering and payment features,”

“While we simultaneously working to strengthen our position as the leading halal R.E.D (Relevant, Easy and Distinctive) brand, we are also proud to contribute to the regional economic growth through employment opportunities that we created along the way. Our extensive operations from Farm to Fork and our presence in four countries thus far have provided employment to over 35,000 people.” he added.

The official opening ceremony was also celebrated with the presence of 50 orphans across Perlis. KFC’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, Add Hope Malaysia presented a donation of RM50,000 to Tuanku Syed Putra Foundation (YTSP) to fund various community and educational programmes to empower the underprivileged in Perlis.

The donation is channeled to Tabung Kebajikan Yayasan in powering its efforts, contributing to educational and socio-economic development for the less fortunate in Perlis, regardless of race and religion in line with the Foundation’s goal.

The RM50,000 fund will be distributed by stages to orphans in need of medical and educational assistance. Each year, the Foundation distributes donations to provide medical equipment for the less fortunate, in collaboration with Unit Kerja Sosial Perubatan Hospital Tuanku Fauziah Kangar.</p>

        <p><b>FIVE IMPOVERISHED SCHOOLS IN KELANTAN TO BENEFIT FROM HEALTHY MEALS PROGRAMME ‘PROMAK’ BY KFC ADD HOPE MALAYSIA AND YOKUK</b></p>
        <p>KELANTAN, 21 NOVEMBER 2019 – KFC Malaysia and YOKUK, ‘A Foundation for the Disabled & Underprivileged’ have come together once again to bring PROGRAM MAKANAN KESIHATAN (ProMak) 2019/2020, a special food programme that provides daily healthy meal to schools in Kelantan, powered by KFC’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) drive – Add Hope Malaysia.

Add Hope Malaysia presented a total of RM250,000 cash donation to YOKUK in a fund handover ceremony held at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Tanah, Pasir Puteh Kelantan. The mock cheque was handed over by Dato’ Seri Mohamed Azahari Mohamed Kamil, Managing Director of QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd (QSR Brands) to Datin Suliana Shamsuddin Alias, Chairman and Executive Director of YOKUK. This ceremony also marks the official launch of the ProMak 2019/2020.

About 644 schoolchildren from five schools will benefit from ProMak 2019/2020, which will be coordinated and monitored by YOKUK and executed by school, with the supervision by dietary officers from the Health Ministry for six months duration. The five schools involved are Sekolah Kebangsaan Ladang Kerila, Tanah Merah, Sekolah Kebangsaan Kg. Bahagia, Kuala Krai, Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Tanah, Pasir Puteh, Sekolah Kebangsaan Biak, Dabong, and Sekolah Kebangsaan Baroh Pial, Pasir Mas. Through this programme, each student is given a healthy lunch box, served at school five times a week.

“Malnutrition has a direct impact on mortality, morbidity, education and long-term neurodevelopment. In line with KFC Add Hope commitment to fight hunger, this food programme aims to empower these young generations with nutritious meal that is essential in developing healthy bodies and minds. They are our future, and this is our step in helping them reach their full potential,” said Dato’ Seri Mohamed Azahari Mohamed Kamil, Managing Director, QSR Brands.

“This collaborative effort between KFC Add Hope Malaysia and YOKUK began in 2015, and we have been able to serve more than 3,000 schoolchildren from 18 schools under the programme thus far. This would be impossible without the generosity shown by our fellow Malaysians. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our KFC customers for their generous contribution towards Add Hope.” he added.

“YOKUK has been serving the disabled and underprivileged communities in Kelantan for the last 20 years reaching out throughout the State for those in need, providing a wide range of services from rehabilitation, welfare and palliative care services. Beyond preventing childhood malnutrition among schoolchildren in rural areas of Kelantan, the impact of ProMak particularly can be seen in many other parts. Most of the schools have shown a record improvement in terms of students’ attendance and co-curriculum achievement; which in turn, allow their parents to focus on their jobs to support the family,” said Datin Suliana Shamsuddin Alias, Chairman and Executive Director of YOKUK.

Joining the fund handover ceremony was Malaysian celebrity and campaign spokesperson, Awal Ashaari. “I am grateful to be part of this meaningful journey with KFC Add Hope. It is truly gratifying to see the smiles of these children and today has inspired me to work harder and give every bit I can to help. We hope that the delicious meals provided by ProMak will boost the children’s motivation to come to school every day and help them to stay focus in class,” said Awal.

Add Hope is KFC’s global Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. This CSR initiative aims to highlight and drive support for the effort to end world hunger.  This includes raising money annually for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and other hunger relief agencies around the globe.

2019 marks the 13th year that KFC Malaysia has supported this global initiative to end world hunger. To date, the campaign has raised more than RM27.5 million locally. Apart from YOKUK, Add Hope Malaysia is also working closely with PERTIWI Soup Kitchen, KECHARA Soup Kitchen Society, HOPE Worldwide Kuala Lumpur, Yayasan Chow Kit, Malaysia Red Crescent (MRC) Community Services – Johor Bahru, as well as the Welfare Department and the Education Department in reaching out to the underprivileged communities.</p>

        <p><b>KFC BRINGS HASSLE-FREE, DRIVE-THRU CONVENIENCE TO SIMPANG AMPAT</b></p>
        <p>PENANG, 8 October 2019 – QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd (QSR Brands), through its wholly owned subsidiary company, QSR Stores Sdn Bhd has entered into a partnership to develop the first KFC drive-thru restaurant in the new, revitalised Simpang Ampat, Penang with developer GUH Holdings Berhad (GUH), through its subsidiary, GUH Development Sdn Bhd.

Anchoring Drive-Thru convenience as one of the integral focus in its strategic expansion plans, QSR Brands is well on its mission to cater to the increasingly busy lifestyles with products and services that are top in class quality and highly accessible to consumers, around the clock.

“Convenience is really winning in today’s business landscape, and that’s what we mean by being relevant and creating brand distinctiveness for our customers. Consumer demands for food that is quick, tasty and convenient have evolved rapidly. Our Drive-Thru has shown a lot of growth potential and this concept will remain as an essential part in our restaurant expansion strategy,” said Dato’ Seri Mohamed Azahari Mohamed Kamil, Group Managing Director, QSR Brands.

“As the largest quick service restaurant operator in the region, we are all about our customers. Strategic collaboration with prominent developer such as GUH, enables us to capitalise and tap into each other’s resources efficiently to cater to the local demand and making it easy and accessible for our customers to enjoy our craveable meals,” added Dato’ Seri Mohamed Azahari.

The partnership between QSR Brands and GUH to bring the first KFC drive-thru restaurant in Simpang Ampat aims to provide the best retail experiences possible to the community, as part of the development’s mission to become a self-contained township.  This move will enhance the township’s value proposition and meet the local demand and is targeted for completion by the third quarter of 2021.

As part of the MoA, GUH will be building the drive-thru restaurant and entering into a long-term lease arrangement with QSR Brands. This is in line with GUH’s strategy to enhance its existing developments as well as improve recurring income for the Group.

“The revitalisation of Simpang Ampat is envisioned to breathe new life into this small town of Penang, with residential component, vast landscape, and integrated infrastructures to accommodate public transport system, lifestyle shops, housing projects and commercial hub, equipped with all aspects of modern green living. The involvement of QSR Brands to bring the first-ever KFC Drive-Thru restaurant in Simpang Ampat will further boost commercial and lifestyle value to the integrated development,” said Dato’ Kenneth H’ng Bak Tee, Group Managing Director, GUH Holdings Berhad.

The KFC drive-thru restaurant will be located on an approximately 30,000 sq ft land besides the main federal road and at the core of GUH land which shall be the centre of attraction to the development.

In conjunction with the signing ceremony, QSR Brands through KFC Malaysia presented a total of RM550,000 collection to Penang State Government in support of the state’s ‘No Plastic Bag’ initiative. The cheque was presented by Dato’ Seri Mohamed Azahari to Yang Berhormat Dato’ Haji Abdul Halim bin Haji Hussain, Penang State Exco for International & Domestic Trade, Consumer Affairs and Entrepreneurship Development.</p>
